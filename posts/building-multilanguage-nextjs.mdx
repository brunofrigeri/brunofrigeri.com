A lot of people, like me, are trying to get jobs outside their own country so to be able to do that we need to learn and master other languages.
In the programming world (and to be honest, in almost all areas that involve technology in some degree), the universal language is the english.

With that, beyond mastering communicating (which I mean, talking and listening) in those languages, we need to write our CV, blog posts and copies in this universal language.
So, today I'll be writing about how to manage a multi-language website using Next.js.

## Setting up the Project

Let's set up our Next.js project using the `create-next-app` lib, which give us a pretty good template (you can follow up to see options in [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app))

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
```

Altought Next.js providers internationalised routing, it doesn't handle management of translation content, so to be able to achieve that we're going to install `next-i18next` dependency for our project:

```bash
yarn add next-i18next react-i18next i18next
# or
npm install --save next-i18next react-i18next i18next
```

## Configuring Next.js with I18n

Following the `next-i18next` documentation, we need set up the project for it:

1. First, create a `next-i18next.config.js` file in the root of your project. 
- Inside it we need to add the locales configuration, based on your locale languages, which in my case is:

```javascript
  module.exports = {
    i18n: {
      defaultLocale: 'en',
      locales: ['en', 'pt-BR'],
    },
  }
```

2. Next, we're going to modify the `next.config.js` file, by passing the i18n config that we previously set up on our `next-i18next.config.js` file.

```javascript
const { i18n } = require('./next-i18next.config')

module.exports = {
  {...}
  i18n,
}
```

3. Now we need to create a `locales` folder inside `public` and create our different languages folder with a `common.json` file each. It's important to say that the `common.json` it's basically a set of texts that will be used for all components, but you can create others for specific components)

```
└── public
    └── locales
        ├── en
        |   └── common.json
        └── pt-BR
            └── common.json
```

4. Mostly important and the last step of the configuration, we need to connect the I18n with our app. Open the `pages/_app.js` directory and wrap the default export with `appWithTranslation` from `next-i18next`, following as below:

```javascript
import '../styles/globals.css'
import { appWithTranslation } from 'next-i18next'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}


export default appWithTranslation(MyApp)
```

That's all! Now we have all configuration set up and we can start using it.

## Implementing different languages in components using SSR

It's important to know that `next-i18next` added support for using SSR, which basically can be done by using the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` from Next.js. But let's continue:

1. Let's define some example text in all our different locale folders, I will be creating a __title__ field:

```javascript
// locale/en/common.json
{
    "title": "Building a multi-language website with Next.js"
}
```

```javascript
// locale/pt-BR/common.json
{
    "title": "Construindo um website com suporte a diversas linguagens, utilizando Next.js"
}
```

2. As mentioned above, to have Next.js support, we need to use `getStaticProps`or `getServerSideProps` (you can check usage details of each [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)). With the decision in place, we're going to import `serverSideTranslations` from `next-i18next` and add to our choosen method.

**getStaticProps**
```javascript
import { serverSideTranslations } from 'next-i18next/serverSideTranslations'

export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale }) => {
  return {
    props: {
      ...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common'])),
    }
  }
}
```

**getServerSideProps**
```javascript
import { serverSideTranslations } from 'next-i18next/serverSideTranslations'

export const getServerSideProps = async ({ locale }) => {
  return {
    props: {
      ...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common'])),
    }
  }
}
```

Another really important thing to remember is that we can have specific translations (as I mentioned prior) for each component. Let's say I created a new file in our locales named `example.json`, and we want to add the translation to the same component. We would do:

```javascript
export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale }) => {
  return {
    props: {
      ...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common',
      'example']))
    }
  }
}
```

3. Last, the display!! Let's add the translation itself to our Component. Let's import `useTranslations` from `react-i18next` dependency and destructure it to get property `t` (which will be then used for translating):

```javascript
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

export default function Home() {
  const { t } = useTranslation('common')

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>
          {t('title')}
        </h1>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}

export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale }) => {
  return {
    props: {
      ...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common']))
    }
  }
}
```

## Seeing the Results

Accessing your `YOUR_URL/$LANGUAGE`, which in my case is `http://localhost:3000/${CURRENT_LANGUAGE}`.

**English -** `http://localhost:3000/en`

## Conclusion

There we have it! I hope the post it's clear and you guys were able to follow. Feel free to tag me into any doubts and providing any feedbacks. In **part 2**, we're going to understand on how to build a simple toggle for changing languages! Stay tuned
